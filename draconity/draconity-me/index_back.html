    </a>
    <p>
        I am a dragon, and I've considered myself to be one for quite a few years now. I know this is quite the bold claim, and the convoluted path I had to tread before I could 
        reach such a realization is not short of mishaps, weirdness and constant change. It is the latter that troubled me for some time because I feared it could take
        away from the legitimacy of my identity and spiritual beliefs, but ultimately I realized that: <br />
        a) The only person that really needs to accept this reality is me, and <br />
        b) Change is healthy, and an inherent part of left-hand spirituality, which is, along with an identity, what draconity is to me. <br />
        <br />
        I am neither afraid of change nor afraid to confront my past and understand it as a stepping stone in the path to figuring out who I am, 
        and at the end of the day there's one thing that remained constant since my awakening: the connection with my dragon. Everything else is just accessory. 
        <br /><br />
        <b>The beginnings: </b>
        <br />
        I always felt a deep, special connection with reptilian creatures, Extinct, extant and "mythological". Well before I knew anything about therianthropy, otherkin, alter-humans
        or any form of identity label/belief system that could in some way represent my experiences, I felt there was something deep inside me that was different and beyond just
        sheer interest. 
        When I was a little kid, I would consume any sort of media that had anything remotely reptilian in them, I wanted to have a reptile as a pet very badly, and I would be the kid that
        suggested to pretend being animals when playing with friends way too often, and of course I always picked dinosaurs, crocodiles, massive lizards, dragons and more often than not: Impossibly large,
        venomous snakes. In all honestly, it was the latter where it all started, and that's my little secret: <i class="spoiler">When I was a kid I was more of a serpent therian than a dragon.</i><br /><br />   
        My obsession eventually led to me thinking I could somehow p-shift and be transported to another world if I tried it hard enough and every night when I went to sleep, I'd lie down in bed and focused on clenching
        every muscle of my body, without actually sending the signal to my muscles. This send what I can only describe as an adrenaline shock throughout my body and a sinking feeling on my chest. I tried to
        last as long as I could but every time I ended up chickening out and stopped, and I was convinced that it was actually fear what kept me from reaching the point where I could go "to the other side".
        <br /><br /><b>The voice: </b><br />
        Around the same time, a voice appeared in my head. I don't exactly remember how and when (I was around 8 years old at the time) but it became a loud, constant commentator of my life.
        He was a guardian and a guide, and certainly extremely blunt when the situation called for it, in fact, it's criticism was sometimes unnecessarily abrasive. I had long, involved conversations
        with this entity, mostly in thought, but sometimes out loud as well. To me, it had no shape or name at that point, and I certainly didn't relate it with my therianthropy, I simply called it 
        "mind", because to me he was just a product of my psyche. As my late teenage years came, it's voice dwindled until it dissapear as my life took a different turn.
        <br /><br />
        <b>The silent period</b><br />
        I was among the few privileged in my country who had internet access by the late 90s. My therianthropy was stronger than ever around that time and therefore I searched (unsuccessfully) for people
        who had similar experiences on the internet. However, I don't know if it was because of my bad English, the primitive search engines back then or just not coming up with the right keywords, but I was never 
        able to find anything. I did end up finding the furry fandom which I thought was as close as it was going to get, but since making an anthro character out of what would have been 
        my theriotype didn't feel right, I soon moved onto other identities and my spirit laid dormant for many years afterward.
<br /><br />
        <b>The return</b>
        Around 2011 I felt the call of the dragon as I learned to know it. I suddenly started feeling that itch I had as a kid, but now I had legs, wings & horns. I surely didn't know
        what I exactly looked like, and there was another problem: calling myself a dragon felt wrong. I didn't think I was worthy of it and assumed I was just a lesser creature wanting to be one, wanting
        to connect with one. As a matter of fact, I even held some resentment towards those who identified as such but in retrospective I think it was more jealousy than anything else.
        <br /> 
        Soon after, poking around I finally found about otherkinism and therianthropy and I joined a couple of online dragonkin communities where I participated briefly because I really didn't have
        enough insight back then to share anything about my experiences, other than this deep connection I felt and how much dragons meant to me spiritually. Honestly, the way I interpreted my draconity
        at the time is a wild story that would need a whole page dedicated to it. <br />
        I sure as hell felt this connection, and made everyone aware of it at the time, even my family, friends & workmates. It was just what I was and I had finally managed to not only connect
        the dots on all my previous experiences but also now I knew I was not alone, even if I didn't actively participate in any community.
        <br />
        Then, around mid 2016, during a very dark period of my life, the voice that once guided came back to me, but this time in the shape of a white dragon. I could see him clearly and I was 
        just full of awe and joy because not only I very much needed his help but because I was finally able to get more insight into my draconity. He explained me how we were essentially two different
        souls deeply connected and that I too really was a dragon myself. That's when I felt myself transforming into one and was transported to a dragon realm of which I only managed to get some glimpses of: a hazy forest in a
        world with a dense atmosphere, a place that seemed to be in perpetual twilight and with a sky which had a purplish tint.<br />
        Feeling ready and finally worthy to call myself one, I went back to dragonkin communities to share my experience, but there was still a long way to go and many things
        to learn still. <br />
        In the following years I had the pleasure of meeting others like me in person, which was a magical experience. Being able to not only talk openly and directly about these subjects
        but feel the draconic power flowing through us was truly amazing, and it got me closer than ever to my dragon guardian, and to my dragon-self. <br />
        In the last few months, I have been experiencing phantom limbs like never before, and I finally decided to do some targeted meditation and rituals to have in-depth interactions with my 
        guardian, as well as to learn more about draconic magic and use it as a tool to finally heal from very deep wounds that have kept me from climbing out the depressive whole where I've been trapped for almost a decade,
        and finally finish that mission we both agreed on facing when he showed up again in 2016. <br /><br />
        Writing this text is part of said process, and something he pushed me hard to do. It wasn't easy and I may update and correct in the future, but for now I think it's a good draft.
