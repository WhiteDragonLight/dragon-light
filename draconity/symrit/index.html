    <h3>Three symbols of unknown meaning</h3>
    <p>
        I've always liked meditation. I find the process insightful and relaxing, but most importantly it let's me connect with my inner dragon and my dragon guardian.
        This is not to say I'm consistent with the practice, although lately I've been trying to do it daily. In one of my latest sessions, my dragon guardian showed me these symbols and while he didn't explain the meaning, 
        he did infer their importance in magic and as such I etched them in wood to use in rituals. The way he showed them to me was by moving his claw in the air, leaving a luminescent trail that vanished quickly.
