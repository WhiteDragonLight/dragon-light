Have you already chosen your enemy, that person the group you 
belong to dictates as such? How does it feel to be so sure about 
your superiority?

Satanic music, social democracy, anti-nationalism. Ideas that might
have been groundbreaking, controversial and subversive decades ago
were molded into the new status quo and yet they're still perceived
as anti-establishment. There's no controversy, no blasphemy against
modern solemn symbols. Kids still listen to satanic ramblings and believe
they're shocking people and proving a point when they're just adhering to 
the new pop culture.
And then, when the slightest spark of subversion surfaces like the alt-right movement
as wrong as their ideas might be, they're soon shut down by society. 
There's no other control mechanism needed by the government than the witch hunt
they've implanted in our society.
<br ></br >
THIS IS WHAT WE DO. We make fun of others, just like it'd happen in class.
You either follow the leader or you are bullied into submission. Otherwise 
people will make a fake story with your photo and post it on the social networks
and people will rush to attack you, threat you and your family and basically
turn your life into hell. 
<br />
Ever wondered why you feel blocked when trying to express an opinion online?
You're conditioned to do that by the thought agents inserted by the government
in evey communitiy. They voices guide the masses, and their trained eloquence
and speech is hard to fight against. Not because their ideas are sound (they're not,
they're mostly noise meant to cause cognitive fatigue and drive others into submission)
but because they sell you a sense of belonging.
<br />
It's a vicious circle. You're talked down into submission and then you
work around your language so it sounds like you're not striding too far away
from the mandated line of thought postulated by the agents
and you finally end up just straight defending their point.

10pm of another young day where I just worked for a few hours and after having had a decent
night of sleep yet I find myself dragged to bed as usual. I'm not tired, I'm being ORDERED,
THEY want me inside the bed and sleeping because THEY now I'm gonna wake up drowsy and 
feeble minded as usual tomorrow. I know they try to play tricks on me all the time, like 
unwinding the tissues in the corner of my eyes. Things they used to do behind my back to hide their
shape but now they don't feel threatened and I can see them almost directly.
I need to reduce the amount of hours I sleep per day, that's what they're using to control me,
along to mixing heavy metals in my water well so I'm slightly but chronically poisoned in a way
that keeps other from suspicion but enough to cloud my mind.
Everyone talks about different thing, some are benevolent and some are not, and sometimes it's
hard to distinguish who is who, and who I should listen to. After all. Who's voice is mine?
Who's voice should judge others and be able to tell the right path from the wrong?
<br /><br />
These are questions I don't have an answer for, but I know them who are trying to keep me 
away from writing this down. These are the voices of confusion, they tell me I'm crazy and at the same
time they tell me I'm sane and just pretending to be crazy because I'm looking for attention.
<br />
There's nothing worse than being trapped inside your own mind with thousands of voices screaming
over yours until you don't know which one is yours anymore as you feel you can't poke your head out 
of the noise anymore.
